# Welcome to the Open Machine Learning blog
This blog brings you stories about OpenML: why we want to streamline machine learning research, how you can use it, and what we are doing. 
We are also open to [your stories](https://github.com/openml/blog#how-to-contribute) about anything related to open machine learning research, education, and applications. 
Join the conversation :).
